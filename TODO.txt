1) Replace the I2S microphone (INMP441) and the DAC (MAX98357A) with a single board that supports mic input and amplified audio output

Solution: Claude suggests using the WM8960 ($15 on Aliexpress)

Here are the priority features and configurations for the WM8960 that we'll implement when the hardware arrives:

1. Noise Reduction Priority Features:
- ALC configuration with fast attack for dynamic road noise
- High-pass filter settings optimized for wind noise (150-200Hz)
- Voice-frequency EQ enhancement (300Hz-3kHz boost)
- Optimized mic gain settings
- Maximum headphone volume adjustment

2. Configuration Sequence:
- Initial power-up and reset sequence
- I2C initialization
- Clock configuration for your sample rate
- ALC and filter enabling
- EQ setup for voice optimization
- Input/output gain staging

3. Additional Testing Points:
- Test different ALC attack/decay times
- Find optimal high-pass filter frequency
- Determine best mic gain vs noise trade-off
- Test various EQ curves for voice clarity

When you receive the boards, we can start with a basic implementation and then fine-tune these parameters based on real-world testing in your convertible.

Would you like me to keep track of anything else for the future implementation?
